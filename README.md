Hi Everyone, 
This repo contanins an overview of our metric store and the problem statement that we are having.
We have simple and formula metrics the simple metrics are just aggeragtions over the measures for that we are using CUBE.dev.
Formula metric will use other metrics, A user will feed formula in the metric builder component and we will parse and evaluate that
formula to generate results.
We did our research and found 2 approaches that looks promising.
